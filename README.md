# 🔬 Interaction Design Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing findings and data from Interaction Design coursework.

## 📋 Overview

These notebooks are designed to help students:
- 📊 Analyze user research data
- 📈 Visualize interaction patterns
- 🔍 Document usability findings
- 💡 Generate insights from user testing
- 📝 Present design recommendations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scipy

### 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## 📓 Notebook Contents

### 1. Fitts's Law Analysis (`fitts_law.ipynb`)
An interactive notebook demonstrating Fitts's Law, a fundamental principle in human-computer interaction that predicts the time required to move to and select a target.

The notebook will soon include:

### 2. Stevens's Power Law Analysis (`stevens_power_law.ipynb`)
Explores psychophysical scaling and the relationship between physical stimuli and perceived intensity in UI elements.

### 3. Hick's Law Demonstration (`hicks_law.ipynb`) 
Analyzes decision-making time based on the number of choices, with practical applications for menu design and interface complexity.

### 4. Miller's Law Investigation (`millers_law.ipynb`)
Examines the "magical number seven plus or minus two" principle and its implications for chunking information in interface design.

### 5. Two-Point Threshold Test (`two_point_threshold.ipynb`)
Studies spatial resolution in touch interfaces and minimum distinguishable distances for touch targets.

### 6. Additional HCI Experiments 🧪
- Gestalt Principles in UI Design
- Color Theory and Perception Tests
- Response Time Analysis
- Error Rate Measurements
- User Attention Tracking
