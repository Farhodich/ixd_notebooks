# 🔬 Interaction Design Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing findings and data from Interaction Design coursework.

## 📋 Overview

These notebooks are designed to help students:
- 📊 Analyze user research data
- 📈 Visualize interaction patterns
- 🔍 Document usability findings
- 💡 Generate insights from user testing
- 📝 Present design recommendations

## 📓 Notebook Contents

### 1. Visual Search Experiment (`hicks_law.ipynb`) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/s-abdullaev/ixd_notebooks/blob/main/hicks_law.ipynb)
Analyzes decision-making time based on the number of choices, with practical applications for menu design and interface complexity.

### 2. Stevens's Power Law Experiment (`stevens.ipynb`) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/s-abdullaev/ixd_notebooks/blob/main/stevens.ipynb)
Explores psychophysical scaling and the relationship between physical stimuli and perceived intensity in UI elements.

### 3. Fitts's Law Experiment (`fitts_law.ipynb`) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/s-abdullaev/ixd_notebooks/blob/main/fitts_law.ipynb)
An interactive notebook demonstrating Fitts's Law, a fundamental principle in human-computer interaction that predicts the time required to move to and select a target.

### 4. Working Memory Decay Analysis (`wm_decay.ipynb`) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/s-abdullaev/ixd_notebooks/blob/main/wm_decay.ipynb)
Analyzes the decay of working memory over time and serial position effects, with applications for information presentation and user interface design.

### 5. Two-Point Threshold Test (`two_point_threshold.ipynb`) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/s-abdullaev/ixd_notebooks/blob/main/two_point_threshold.ipynb)
Studies spatial resolution in touch interfaces and minimum distinguishable distances for touch targets.

<!-- ### 4. Miller's Law Investigation (`millers_law.ipynb`)
Examines the "magical number seven plus or minus two" principle and its implications for chunking information in interface design.


### 6. Additional HCI Experiments 🧪
- Gestalt Principles in UI Design
- Color Theory and Perception Tests
- Response Time Analysis
- Error Rate Measurements
- User Attention Tracking -->
